- react is SPA(single page app) and react-dom is for dealing with web like react-native is for mobile, with no functionality for routing which is compensated by libraries like react-dom, handled by bundlers like CRA (creat-react-app), vite etc
- in CRA's index.js we dont have a script tag but it works with the help of react-scripts library
- first step after creating a react or any other project is to head to the package.json file (if its there of course)
- package-lock.json has dependencies version locked for stability and other stuff
- manifest.json is for mobile apps
- robot.txt is for search engine
- components instead in jsx can also be written like functions, for ex `<App/>` can be replaced by `App()` in jsx. But this shouldnt be done to maintain code conventions and readability. This is possible because of course a component is actually a function.
- react takes care of the ui changes
- when page reloads it actually creates the whole DOM again and repaints the screen
